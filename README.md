# React Component Practice

## Live Demo:
https://samuel-curtis.github.io/component-practice/

## Description:
This project is a React/TypeScript application designed as a learning playground to explore and showcase various components in an interactive environment. It features a sidebar with dropdown menus organizing components into different categories, allowing users to seamlessly select and view different components in the main content area.

This project was built using Vite, and it was created to deepen my understanding of and gain experience with React. It serves as a hands-on experiment for me to create and organize React components.  

## Future Improvments

- Finish components that were initially planned 
  - ~~Analytics Screen~~
